1. Why do we have a __init__.py inside a folder? and why is there nothing in the file?
2. What does the import in the main.py do?
    ->sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspaht(__file__))))

3. __init__.py -> why are we importing the nodes separately -> are all of these classes?
4. why are we importing __init__.py and why is it empty?
